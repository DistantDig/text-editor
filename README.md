  # Text Editor

  ## Description

  This application is a practice project for myself to sharpen my skills using webpack. The application record the user's input and stores the data in a database once the application loses focus. If the user leaves, closes or refreshes the page, the user will find that all of the entered text will persist until the next viewing of the page.

  ## Installation

  To install the application on your local machine, start by cloning the repository to a local file. Once the application has been cloned and you have navigated into the source folder via your terminal, run the command 'npm i' to install all of the needed dependencies. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run the command 'npm start' to run the server on your local machine.

  ## Usage

  Navigate to the deployed link located [here](https://morning-wildwood-51946-e26e119db1ee.herokuapp.com/), or to http://localhost:3000/ if you installed the application locally. Once there, any text added to the page will persist for the user.
